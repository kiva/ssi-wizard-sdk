### Description

This component is designed to facilitate the issuing of a new credential by collecting user information.

### Props

* `phoneIntls`

The `phoneIntls` object is the configuration object that is passed in to the phone number input component on this screen. We use the [react-phone-input-2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-phone-input-2) component for this, so the value of `phoneIntls` should be a valid configuration object for it.
